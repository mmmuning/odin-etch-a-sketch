## ETCH-A-SKETCH

This project is part of The Odin Project’s **Foundations Course**. It’s an interactive browser-based drawing grid inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. The project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling using JavaScript.

### This project includes:

- A dynamically generated grid of adjustable size (up to 100×100)
- A “Clear” button that resets and resizes the grid
- Hover effects that progressively darken each cell
- Use of JavaScript to create, style, and manage DOM elements
- Clean and responsive layout built with Flexbox

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically
- Handling user interactions and events (hover, click, prompt)
- Using data attributes to track and modify element states
- Implementing progressive visual effects with JavaScript and CSS
